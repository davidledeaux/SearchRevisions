# SearchRevisions
Searches Rally revisions for a specified string.  The script searches 1 week of revisions going back as many weeks as indicated in the weeks_max variable.

Edit the search_string and weeks_max variables to the desired text to search for and the number of weeks back that you want to include in the search.
